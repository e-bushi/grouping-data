    In this file, we'll learn about Dictionaries in Swift.

    Dictionaries are another collection type like arrays, sets, etc. but they store values in a completely different way.
    Dictionaries to the computer operate just like human dictionaries.
    In a human dictionary, you have a word and a definition.
    In a computer dictionary, you have a key and a value.

    Let's look at an example of a dictionary in Swift.

    var dictionary = ["open sesame": "Treasure Awaits"]

    In this example, we have a dictionary with a key of "open sesame" and a value of "Treasure Awaits".

    Let's look at another example.

    var dictionary = ["open sesame": "Treasure Awaits", "alakazam": "Magic Happens"]

    Here, we have a dictionary with two keys and two values.

    If I wanted to access the value of a key, I would do the following.

    let value = dictionary["open sesame"]

    This would set the value variable to "Treasure Awaits".

    Dictionaries work really well when you need to store a lot of information about something, and
    you need to access that information quickly.

    You could use a dictionary if you needed to store a list of names and phone numbers for example.
    You could add names and phone numbers to the dictionary quickly and you could access the phone number
    for a name quickly as well.
