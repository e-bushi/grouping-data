    // BitCountingExercise.swift
     Swift programming exercise for beginners
    
     TASK:
    
     You need to write a function with the following specifications:
     1. The function name should be 'binaryZeroCount'
     2. It should take one parameter:
        - An Integer, let's call it 'number'
    
     Here is the function signature for reference:
     func binaryZeroCount(number: Int) -> (binary: String, zeroCount: Int)
    
     REQUIREMENTS:
    
     Your task is to convert the 'number' to its binary representation and count the number of zeros in this binary version.
     Your function should return a tuple containing the binary string and the zero count.
    
     The tuple should be in the following format: (binary, zeroCount). 'binary' should be a string representing the binary version of 'number', 
     and 'zeroCount' should be an integer representing the number of zeros in the 'binary' string.
    
     You can assume that 'number' will be a non-negative integer.
    
     Good luck! 
     Note: Please write your code below this comment.
