/*
    VowelCountExercise.swift

    Your task in this exercise is to get some hands-on practice with Swift, 
    specifically with strings, arrays, tuples and functions.

    Your objective: 

    You are required to write a function that fulfills the following conditions:
    1. The function should take a string as an argument.
    2. It should return an array of tuples.
    3. Each tuple in the array should contain a vowel character in the first position.
    4. The second position of each tuple should contain the count of how many times that particular vowel appears in the string.

    Here's an outline of what the function might look like to get you started:

    ```
    func vowelCount(in text: String) -> [(Character, Int)] {
        // Your code goes here
    }
    ```

    A few things to keep in mind:
    - The vowels we're interested in are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' (both lower and upper case should be considered).
    - Remember to iterate over each character in the string.
    - Consider how you might keep track of the number of times you encounter each vowel.
    - The returned array of tuples should only include the vowels that actually appear in the string. If a vowel doesn't appear in the string, it should not be included in the returned array.

    Good luck with your coding!
