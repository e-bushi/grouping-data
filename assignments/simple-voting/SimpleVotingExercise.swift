    SimpleVotingExercise.swift
    Swift programming exercise for beginners

    TASK:

    You need to write a function with the following specifications:
    1. The function name should be 'findWinner'
    2. It should take one parameter:
        - A dictionary of type [String: Int], let's call it 'votes'

    Here is the function signature for reference:
    func findWinner(votes: [String: Int]) -> String

    REQUIREMENTS:

    Your task is to simulate a simple voting system. The 'votes' dictionary will contain pairs of 'candidate name' (key) and 'number of votes' (value).
    You need to find the candidate with the highest number of votes and return the name of that candidate. 

    If there are multiple candidates with the same highest number of votes, you can return the name of any one of those candidates. 

    You can assume that the 'votes' dictionary will not be empty and will always contain at least one candidate.

    Good luck!
    Note: Please write your code below this comment.

    Here's an example votes dictionary:

    let votes = [
        "Alex": 10,
        "Michael": 20,
        "Harry": 5,
        "Dave": 10,
        "Michael": 15,
        "Harry": 10,
        "Dave": 5
    ]
