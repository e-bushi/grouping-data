    MaxMinExercise.swift
    Swift programming exercise

    TASK:

    You need to write a function with the following specifications:
    1. The function name should be 'findMaxMin'
    2. It should take one parameter:
        - An array of Integers, let's call it 'numbers'

    Here is the function signature for reference:
    func findMaxMin(numbers: [Int]) -> (max: Int, min: Int)?

    REQUIREMENTS:

    Your task is to find the maximum and minimum values in the 'numbers' array. 
    Your function should return these values as a tuple in the following order: (max, min). 
    
    If the 'numbers' array is empty, your function should return nil.

    You can assume that if the 'numbers' array is not empty, it will always contain at least one integer.

    Good luck!
