    * TwoSumExercise.swift

    TASK:

    You need to write a function with the following specifications:
    1. The function name should be 'findTwoSum'
    2. It should take two parameters:
        - An array of Integers, let's call it 'numbers'
        - A target Integer, let's call it 'target'

    Here is the function signature for reference:
    func findTwoSum(numbers: [Int], target: Int) -> (Int, Int)?

    REQUIREMENTS:

    Your task is to find two different items in the 'numbers' array such that when they are added together, they give the 'target' value. 
    If such a pair is found, your function should return their indices in a tuple like so: (index1, index2). 
    Note that 'index1' and 'index2' are the indices of the two numbers in the 'numbers' array, and NOT the numbers themselves.

    If no such pair exists, your function should return nil.

    You can assume that the 'numbers' array will always have at least two elements and the 'target' value will always be an integer.

    Good luck!
    Note: Please write your code below this comment.
